# Kramster API

The server for kramster.it used to be part of the [Kramster](https://github.com/draperunner/kramster) repository, but now the frontend and backend have been split apart!

## Get Started

```
npm install
npm start
```

The server will run on port 8000, unless specified with the `PORT` environment variable.

This project uses `dotenv`, so you can create a file called `.env` in the root with your variables.
